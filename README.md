# Machine-Learning-Final-Project

This repository contains all the necessary data files and the notebook used to create my machine learning final project. The two JSON files song_data0 and playlist_data0 are the data files. SONG_DATA0.JSON IS CURRENTLY EMPTY BECAUSE IT IS TOO LARGE TO UPLOAD TO GITHUB. Instead, take each of the song_data0# text files and copy them, in order, into songs_data0.json to make sure that it stores the information it should. The attached notebook will handle importing, data extraction and preparation, building the models, and testing the models. The file read_data_methods.py contains all of the methods and the API setup that I used to convert the data read from the million playlist dataset and create songs_data0 and playlist_data0. A more in depth description of the data files and notebook can be found in my paper.
