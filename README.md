# Machine-Learning-Final-Project

This repository contains all the necessary data files and the notebook used to create my machine learning final project. The two JSON files song_data0 and playlist_data0 are the data files. The attached notebook will handle importing, data extraction and preparation, building the models, and testing the models. A more in depth description of the data files and notebook can be found in my paper. The documentation for the Spotify Web Api, Keras Models class, and TensorFlow can be found at the following links: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api
